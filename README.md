# Competitive-Programming
This repository contains my solutions to problems from various competitive programming platforms including Codeforces, CodeChef, AtCoder, HackerRank, and HackerEarth. The goal of this repository is to provide a collection of my personal code submissions to help improve my problem-solving skills and share solutions with others in the competitive programming community.

Features:
Problem Links: Each solution is accompanied by the link to the respective problem.
Language Used: Solutions are written in C++.
Optimized Approaches: Where possible, I focus on writing efficient and optimized code to solve problems.

How to Use:
Each folder contains problem statements and the solution files.
You can clone or download this repository to explore the solutions in your local environment.

Feel free to fork the repository, contribute by submitting issues or pull requests, or suggest improvements to my solutions.
